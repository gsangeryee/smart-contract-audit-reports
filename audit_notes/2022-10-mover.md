## [H-01] Attacker can steal the accumulated topup fees in the `topupproxy` contract's balance

### Summary

The accumulated fees in the `topupproxy` contract's balance can be stolen by an attacker by using malicious `_bridgeTxData` and using `1inch`'s as `targetAddress`.
### Vulnerability Detail

This attack vector is enabled by multiple traits of the `topupproxy` contract:

#### 1. Shared whitelist

Per to deploy script, the same `trustedregistry` will be shared among `exchangeproxy` and `topupproxy`.

Therefore, the 2 whitelisted swap aggregator contracts will also be allowed to be called on `topupproxy`:

- 0x Proxy
- 1inch Proxy

And the 2 whitelisted bridge contracts can be called on `exchangeproxy`:

- Synapse
- Across
#### 2. Unlimited allowance rather than only the amount of the current topup to the bridge's `targetAddress`

At L414, the `targetAddress` will be granted an unlimited allowance rather than just the amount of the current transaction.

```solidity
        resetAllowanceIfNeeded(IERC20Upgradeable(cardTopupToken), targetAddress, _amount);
```
#### 3. `1inch` can be used to pull an arbitrary amount of funds from the caller and execute arbitrary call

The design of `1inch`'s `AggregationRouterV4` can be used to pull funds from the `topupproxy` and execute arbitrary external call:

```solidity
        if (!srcETH) {
            _permit(address(srcToken), desc.permit);
            srcToken.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, desc.srcReceiver, desc.amount);
        }
        {
            bytes memory callData = abi.encodePacked(caller.callBytes.selector, bytes12(0), msg.sender, data);
            // solhint-disable-next-line avoid-low-level-calls
            (bool success, bytes memory result) = address(caller).call{value: msg.value}(callData);
            if (!success) {
                revert(RevertReasonParser.parse(result, "callBytes failed: "));
            }
        }
```
#### 4. The topup fee will be left in the contract's balance

```solidity
        // fee is deducted in receiving token (USDC)
        if (topupFee != 0) {
            uint256 feeAmount = amountReceived.mul(topupFee).div(1e18);
            amountReceived = amountReceived.sub(feeAmount);
        }
```

Combining all the 3 above together, the attacker can call `CardTopupPermit() -> _processTopup() -> 1inch#swap()` and drain all the funds in the contract:

- _token: cardTopupToken
- _bridgeType: 0
- _bridgeTxData:
    - targetAddress: 1inch Proxy
    - callData:
        - amount: all the topupproxy's balance
        - srcReceiver: attacker's address
### Impact

All the accumulated fees can be stolen by the attacker.
### Recommended Mitigation

1. The accumulated fees should not be left in the contract;
2. Only give the whitelisted `targetAddress` the allowance of the amount (`_amount`) transferred into the `topupproxy` contract within this transaction from the caller;
3. The whitelist should not be shared.
### Discussion
**McMannaman**

I think that it's a low vulnerability (user funds are not affected by this and fees are harvested from time to time anyway in the normal flow of operation). But, regardless -- this issue has a valid point.

**McMannaman** Added reentrancy protection (also for issue #120) Plus an additional check that only the USDC amount expected is deducted from contract when bridging regardless of bytes call data. [

**WatchPug**

1. It's better to ensure that the whitelist is not shared between the two contracts. Otherwise, the attacker can still steal the topup fee from HardenedTopupProxy by using 1inch as targetAddress in their _bridgeTxData. Can you also make the changes required to the deploy script to reflect that?
2. Seems like the attacker can still steal the exchange fee sitting on the exchangeProxyContract.

**McMannaman**

1. I have updated the migrations to reflect that whitelists would be separated (and 2 child contracts just to keep migrations-compatible).
2. Could you please elaborate on how the attacker could steal exchange fee on the exchangeProxyContract? The fees are (if they would be non-zero) in USDC-only (the target token would be USDC), or, more generally in some single token, fees could be claimed before token change, before, e.g. hypothetically, to USDT. from draining fees:
(non-swap scenario):

3. an amount is stated as parameter when calling topup, then that amount is transferred to the Topup proxy;
4. no swap is called;
5. bridged amount is checked to exactly match provided amount (regardless of what is provided/called in the bridge data/call);

(swap scenario):

1. an amount is stated as parameter when calling topup, then that amount is transferred to the Topup proxy;
2. swap is called, the actual received amount in USDC is now the amount we're working with (regardless of what is provided/called in the bridge data/call) -- deducting fees on both proxies;
3. bridged amount is checked to exactly match amount stated by Exchange proxy (regardless of what is provided/called in the bridge data/call);

so there are several assumptions we're working with:
- fees are collected in single token type (otherwise they can be stolen, yes);
- exchange proxy is callable only by Transfer proxy ;
- if user uses some manipulation to escape (avoid paying own) fees (don't know how this is achievable though without reentrancy) -- this is violation of terms of use, even if possible, should be of little rationale to user;
    
Please point if I'm missing something (no code examples needed, just a description would be enough).

Yeah, I think this is the case where the accumulated fees on the `exchangeProxyContract` can be stolen.

I agree that this is not a major risk, though.
### Notes

Cross-Contract Privilege Escalation
- Different contracts share access control mechanisms (like whitelists) that should be separate
- Contracts grant excessive privileges (like unlimited allowances) beyond what's needed
- Accumulated value is stored in a contract that also processes transactions
