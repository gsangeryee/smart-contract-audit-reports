## [M-01] Users depositing to a pool with unrealized losses will take on the losses
----
- **Tags**: #vault #front-running #business_logic 
- Number of finders: 5
- Difficulty: Medium
---
### Detail
The pool share price used for deposits is always the `totalAssets() / totalSupply`, however the pool share price when redeeming is `totalAssets() - unrealizedLosses() / totalSupply`. The `unrealizedLosses` value is increased by loan impairments (`LM.impairLoan`) or when starting triggering a default with a liquidation (`LM.triggerDefault`). The totalAssets are only reduced by this value when the loss is realized in `LM.removeLoanImpairment` or `LM.finishCollateralLiquidation`.

This leads to a time window where deposits use a much higher share price than current redemptions and future deposits. Users depositing to the pool during this time window are almost guaranteed to make losses when they are realized. In the worst case, a `Pool.deposit` might even be (accidentally) front-run by a loan impairment or liquidation.
### Recommended Mitigation

Make it very clear to the users when there are unrealized losses and communicate that it is a bad time to deposit. Furthermore, consider adding an `expectedMinimumShares` parameter that is checked against the actual minted shares. This ensures that users don't accidentally lose shares when front-run. Note that this would need to be a new `deposit(uint256 assets_, address receiver_, uint256 expectedMinimumShares_)` function to not break the ERC4626 compatibility.

The `Pool.mint` function has a similar issue, whereas the `Pool.mintWithPermit` function already accepts a `maxAssets_` parameter.
### Discussion
**Maple**: 
Yes our team is aware of this issue and plan on making it very clear to users through our front end and documentation that it is not recommended depositing while there are unrealized losses. The alternative of not using two exchange rates introduces another vulnerability which is that users could front run a payment or reversion of an impairment and make a large amount off of the exchange rate change. 

**Spearbit**: Acknowledged.
### Notes & Impressions

#### Key Concepts
- **Pool Share Price**: The value of one share in the pool, calculated as:
	- For **deposits**: `totalAssets() / totalSupply`
	- For **redemptions**: `(totalAssets() - unrealizedLosses()) / totalSupply`
- **Unrealized Losses**: Losses that have been recognized (e.g., through loan impairments or defaults) but not yet subtracted from `totalAssets()`. These are tracked in the `unrealizedLosses()` value.
- **Realized Losses**: Losses that are fully accounted for in `totalAssets()`, which happens only when specific actions (e.g., removing a loan impairment or completing a liquidation) are executed.
#### The Issue
The pool uses two different formulas to determine the share price:
- When a user **deposits**, the share price is based solely on `totalAssets() / totalSupply`, ignoring any `unrealizedLosses()`.
- When a user **redeems**, the share price accounts for those losses, using `(totalAssets() - unrealizedLosses()) / totalSupply`.

**Unrealized losses** increase when events like loan impairments (`LM.impairLoan`) or liquidation triggers (`LM.triggerDefault`) occur. However, these losses are not subtracted from `totalAssets()` until they are **realized** via actions such as `LM.removeLoanImpairment` or `LM.finishCollateralLiquidation`. This creates a **time window** where:
- The deposit share price is **inflated** (higher than it should be) because it doesn’t reflect unrealized losses.
- The redemption share price is **lower**, as it does account for those losses.
Users depositing during this window buy shares at an overvalued price. When the losses are eventually realized, `totalAssets()` decreases, reducing the share price and causing the depositor to lose value.
#### Example Scenario
Consider a pool with:
- `totalAssets() = 1000`
- `totalSupply = 100 shares`
- `unrealizedLosses() = 100`

- **Deposit Share Price**: `1000 / 100 = 10 assets per share`
- **Redemption Share Price**: `(1000 - 100) / 100 = 9 assets per share`

If a user deposits 100 assets:
- They receive `100 / 10 = 10 shares`.
- If they redeem immediately, they get `10 * 9 = 90 assets`, losing 10 assets instantly.

Later, when the losses are realized:
- `totalAssets()` becomes 900.
- Share price drops to `900 / 100 = 9 assets per share`.
- Their 10 shares are now worth 90 assets, confirming the loss.



#### Impressions

**General Principle**: _Inconsistent or incomplete valuation mechanisms in transaction pricing can lead to mispricing and unfair outcomes for participants._

## [M-03] Unaccounted collateral is mishandled in `triggerDefault`
----
- **Tags**: #business_logic 
- Number of finders: 5
- Difficulty: Hard
---
### Detail

The control flow of `triggerDefault` is partially determined by the value of `MapleLoanLike(loan_- ).collateral() == 0`. The code later assumes there are 0 collateral tokens in the loan if this value is true, which is incorrect in the case of unaccounted collateral tokens. 

In non-liquidating repossessions, this causes an overestimation of the number of `fundsAsset` tokens repossessed, leading to a revert in the `_disburseLiquidationFunds` function. Anyone can trigger this revert by manually transferring 1` Wei` of `collateralAsset` to the loan itself. 

In liquidating repossessions, a similar issue causes the code to call the liquidator's `setCollateralRemaining` function with only accounted collateral, meaning unaccounted collateral will be `unused/stuck` in the liquidator. 
### Recommendation

In both cases, use the collateral token's `balanceOf` function to measure the amount of collateral tokens in the loan, for example:

```solidity
-   if (IMapleLoanLike(loan_).collateral() == 0 || IMapleLoanLike(loan_).collateralAsset() == fundsAsset){ 
+   address collateralAsset_ = IMapleLoanLike(loan_).collateralAsset(); 
+   if (IERC20Like(collateralAsset_ ).balanceOf(loan_) == 0 || collateralAsset_== fundsAsset) {
```

### Discussion

### Notes & Impressions

Imagine two separate records tracking money:

1. **The Ledger** (`MapleLoanLike(loan_).collateral()`):
    - An internal record maintained by the loan contract
    - Tracks "officially recognized" collateral
    - Can be manually updated only through specific contract methods
    - Represents the contract's "official" understanding of collateral
2. **The Bank Account Balance** (`IERC20Like(collateralAsset).balanceOf(loan_)`):
    - The actual token balance at the loan's contract address
    - Reflects ALL token transfers, including unexpected ones
    - Updated automatically by the ERC20 token's transfer mechanisms
    - Represents the raw, unfiltered token amount
##### The Discrepancy Scenario

When someone transfers 1 wei directly to the loan contract:

- Token ledger (ERC20 balance) increases by 1 wei
- Loan contract's internal collateral record remains unchanged
- This creates a "shadow" balance not recognized by the contract's logic
#### Impressions

*Always verify on-chain state for critical operations, especially when handling external assets or user inputs.*
- The balances maintained by ERC20 contract are considered trustworthy.
