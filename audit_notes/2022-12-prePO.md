## [H-01] griefing / blocking / delaying users to withdraw
----
- **Tags**: #business_logic #withdraw 
- Number of finders: 5
- Difficulty: Medium

### Detail

To withdraw, a user needs to convert his collateral for the base token. This is done in the **withdraw** function in Collateral.

The `WithdrawHook` has some security mechanics that can be activated like a global max withdraw in a specific timeframe, also for users to have a withdraw limit for them in a specific timeframe. It also collects the fees.

The check for the user withdraw is wrongly implemented and can lead to an unepexted delay for a user with a `position > userWithdrawLimitPerPeriod`. To withdraw all his funds he needs to be the first in every first new epoch `(lastUserPeriodReset + userPeriodLength)` to get his amount out. If he is not the first transaction in the new epoch, he needs to wait for a complete new epoch and depending on the timeframe from `lastUserPeriodReset + userPeriodLength` this can get a long delay to get his funds out.

The documentation says, that after every epoch all the user withdraws will be reset and they can withdraw the next set.

```
File: apps/smart-contracts/core/contracts/interfaces/IWithdrawHook.sol
63:   /**
64:    * @notice Sets the length in seconds for which user withdraw limits will
65:    * be evaluated against. Every time `userPeriodLength` seconds passes, the
66:    * amount withdrawn for all users will be reset to 0. This amount is only
```

But the implementation only resets the amount for the first user that interacts with the contract in the new epoch and leaves all other users with their old limit. This can lead to a delay for every user that is on his limit from a previous epoch until they manage to be the first to interact with the contract in the new epoch.
### Proof of Concept

The following test shows how a user is locked out to withdraw if he's at his limit from a previous epoch and another withdraw is done before him.

`apps/smart-contracts/core/test/WithdrawHook.test.ts`

```
  describe('user withdraw is delayd', () => {
    beforeEach(async () => {
      await withdrawHook.setCollateral(collateral.address)
      await withdrawHook.connect(deployer).setWithdrawalsAllowed(true)
      await withdrawHook.connect(deployer).setGlobalPeriodLength(0)
      await withdrawHook.connect(deployer).setUserPeriodLength(TEST_USER_PERIOD_LENGTH)
      await withdrawHook.connect(deployer).setGlobalWithdrawLimitPerPeriod(0)
      await withdrawHook.connect(deployer).setUserWithdrawLimitPerPeriod(TEST_USER_WITHDRAW_LIMIT)
      await withdrawHook.connect(deployer).setDepositRecord(depositRecord.address)
      await withdrawHook.connect(deployer).setTreasury(treasury.address)
      await withdrawHook.connect(deployer).setTokenSender(tokenSender.address)
      await testToken.connect(deployer).mint(collateral.address, TEST_GLOBAL_DEPOSIT_CAP)
      await testToken.connect(deployer).mint(user.address, TEST_GLOBAL_DEPOSIT_CAP)
      await testToken.connect(deployer).mint(user2.address, TEST_GLOBAL_DEPOSIT_CAP)
      await testToken
        .connect(collateralSigner)
        .approve(withdrawHook.address, ethers.constants.MaxUint256)
      tokenSender.send.returns()
    })

    it('reverts if user withdraw limit exceeded for period', async () => {
      
      // first withdraw with the limit amount for a user
      await withdrawHook.connect(collateralSigner).hook(user.address, TEST_USER_WITHDRAW_LIMIT, TEST_USER_WITHDRAW_LIMIT)      
      expect(await withdrawHook.getAmountWithdrawnThisPeriod(user.address)).to.eq(TEST_USER_WITHDRAW_LIMIT)
      
      // we move to a new epoch in the future
      const previousResetTimestamp = await getLastTimestamp(ethers.provider)
      await setNextTimestamp(
        ethers.provider,
        previousResetTimestamp + TEST_USER_PERIOD_LENGTH + 1
      )
      
      // now another user is the first one to withdraw in this new epoch      
      await withdrawHook.connect(collateralSigner).hook(user2.address, TEST_USER_WITHDRAW_LIMIT, TEST_USER_WITHDRAW_LIMIT)      
      expect(await withdrawHook.getAmountWithdrawnThisPeriod(user2.address)).to.eq(TEST_USER_WITHDRAW_LIMIT)
      
      // this will revert, because userToAmountWithdrawnThisPeriod[_sender] is not reset
      // but it should not revert as it's a new epoch and the user didn't withdraw yet
      await expect(
        withdrawHook.connect(collateralSigner).hook(user.address, 1, 1)
      ).to.revertedWith('user withdraw limit exceeded')
      
    })
  })
```

To get the test running you need to add `let user2: SignerWithAddress` and the user2 in `await ethers.getSigners()`

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

The check how the user periods are handled need to be changed. One possible way is to change the `lastUserPeriodReset` to a mapping like `mapping(address => uint256) private lastUserPeriodReset` to track the time for every user separately.

With a mapping you can change the condition to:

```
File: apps/smart-contracts/core/contracts/WithdrawHook.sol
18:   mapping(address => uint256) lastUserPeriodReset;

File: apps/smart-contracts/core/contracts/WithdrawHook.sol
66:     if (lastUserPeriodReset[_sender] + userPeriodLength < block.timestamp) {
67:       lastUserPeriodReset[_sender] = block.timestamp;
68:       userToAmountWithdrawnThisPeriod[_sender] = _amountBeforeFee;
69:     } else {
70:       require(userToAmountWithdrawnThisPeriod[_sender] + _amountBeforeFee <= userWithdrawLimitPerPeriod, "user withdraw limit exceeded");
71:       userToAmountWithdrawnThisPeriod[_sender] += _amountBeforeFee;
72:     }
```

With this change, we can change the test to how we would normaly expect the contract to work and see that it is correct.

```
    it('withdraw limit is checked for every use seperatly', async () => {
      
      // first withdraw with the limit amount for a user
      await withdrawHook.connect(collateralSigner).hook(user.address, TEST_USER_WITHDRAW_LIMIT, TEST_USER_WITHDRAW_LIMIT)      
      
      // we move to a new epoch in the future
      const previousResetTimestamp = await getLastTimestamp(ethers.provider)
      await setNextTimestamp(
        ethers.provider,
        previousResetTimestamp + TEST_USER_PERIOD_LENGTH + 1
      )
      
      // now another user is the first one to withdraw in this new epoch      
      await withdrawHook.connect(collateralSigner).hook(user2.address, TEST_USER_WITHDRAW_LIMIT, TEST_USER_WITHDRAW_LIMIT)      
      
      // the first user also can withdraw his limit in this epoch
      await withdrawHook.connect(collateralSigner).hook(user.address, TEST_USER_WITHDRAW_LIMIT, TEST_USER_WITHDRAW_LIMIT)      
      
      // we move the time, but stay in the same epoch
      const previousResetTimestamp2 = await getLastTimestamp(ethers.provider)
      await setNextTimestamp(
        ethers.provider,
        previousResetTimestamp2 + TEST_USER_PERIOD_LENGTH - 1
      )

      // this now will fail as we're in the same epoch
      await expect(
        withdrawHook.connect(collateralSigner).hook(user.address, 1, 1)
      ).to.revertedWith('user withdraw limit exceeded')
      
    })
```

When a protocol manages user-specific operations (like withdrawals or deposits), each user's critical state variables should be isolated in mappings rather than sharing global variables that affect multiple users.

# Medium Risk Findings (xx)

---
## [M-04] PrePO NFT holders will not be able to redeem collateral
----
- **Tags**: #business_logic #authorization_asymmetry #access_control 
- Number of finders: 1
- Difficulty: Medium
---
The protocol has set a limitation on who can participate in the protocol activities.

1. Users who are included in an allowed list: `_accountList`.
2. Users who own specific NFTs that are supported by NFTScoreRequirement. These NFTs are PrePO NFTs that were minted to accounts that historically participated in PrePO activities.

Users who are #2 that deposited funds into the protocol are not able to redeem collateral tokens and withdraw their `profits/funds` from the market. (Loss of funds).
### Proof of Concept
When a user has deposited, the protocol checks if the user is permitted to participate in the protocol activities by checking #1 and #2 from the Impact section. The check is done in the `hook` function in `DepositHook`:
```
  function hook(address _sender, uint256 _amountBeforeFee, uint256 _amountAfterFee) external override onlyCollateral {
-----
    if (!_accountList.isIncluded(_sender)) require(_satisfiesScoreRequirement(_sender), "depositor not allowed");
-----
  }
```

After a user has deposited and received collateral tokens, he will trade it in uniswap pools to receive `Long/Short` tokens either manually or through the `depositAndTrade` function.

When the user decided to `redeem` through the market in order to receive the collateral tokens and his funds/profits, the user will not be able to receive it because only users that are in the account list (#1) will pass the checks. Users who participated because they own NFT (#2) will get a revert when calling the function.

`redeem` in `PrePOMarket`:

```
  function redeem(uint256 _longAmount, uint256 _shortAmount) external override nonReentrant {
-----
      _redeemHook.hook(msg.sender, _collateralAmount, _collateralAmount - _expectedFee);
-----
  }
```

`hook` function in `RedeemHook`:

```
  function hook(address sender, uint256 amountBeforeFee, uint256 amountAfterFee) external virtual override onlyAllowedMsgSenders {
    require(_accountList.isIncluded(sender), "redeemer not allowed");
----
  }
```

As you can see above, only users that are in the account list will be able to redeem. NFT holders will receive a revert of "redeemer not allowed".

### Hardhat POC

There is an already implemented test where `hook` will revert if the user is not in the allowed list:

```
    it('reverts if caller not allowed', async () => {
      msgSendersAllowlist.isIncluded.returns(false)
      expect(await msgSendersAllowlist.isIncluded(user.address)).to.be.false

      await expect(redeemHook.connect(user).hook(user.address, 1, 1)).to.be.revertedWith(
        'msg.sender not allowed'
      )
    })
```
### Recommended Mitigation

Add an additional check in `DepositHook` to NFT holders through `NFTScoreRequirement`.
### Discussion

**ramenforbreakfast (prePO) disputed and commented:**

> We should have been more clear with this, but when users `redeem` their positions, we intend to simply deactivate the `AccountList`, since we only want to gate initial deposits in the system, the amount of underlying within the system. If someone has a position they'd like to redeem once AMM pools are closed, they will be able to via `redeem` since we would not have an ACL configured at that point in time.

**Picodes (judge) commented:**

> @ramenforbreakfast I get your point, but the finding is valid for the codebase and documentation that was audited, right? Anyone obtaining the tokens through a transfer or by minting with a NFT would not be able to redeem with the audited hook.

**ramenforbreakfast (prePO) commented:**

> I think another problem with this finding, is it assumes that the `AccountList` used for `DepositHook` (for minting `Collateral`) and `RedeemHook` for `PrePOMarket` will be the same. In the diagram provided, each `AccountList` is denoted with a number to clarify that these are different `AccountList` instances.
> The `RedeemHook` `AccountList` is a separate list, that will essentially only allow `governance` to redeem positions via the market contract directly, _until_ the UniswapV3 pool is closed and final redemptions are allowed by all users.
> While I agree that this finding would have been valid given we did not document this well, I think the assumption that these lists would be the same and affect one another _was_ documented and this issue is incorrectly assuming otherwise.

**Picodes (judge) commented:**

> I don't think this issue assumes that the two `AccountList` are exactly the same, it just highlights that some users may be allowed to mint but not to redeem, which would lead to a loss of funds.
> They could still trade their tokens with someone whitelisted but the risk that they have to take a loss or are left unable to redeem is high.
> However, you're right to highlight that technically the governance could add every NFT holder in the redeem `AccountList`, so could mitigate this.
> Also, to clarify @ramenforbreakfast, do you intend to deactivate the `AccountList` by removing the `redeemHook`? Or is there a way in `redeemHook` to deactivate the `AccountList`?

**ramenforbreakfast (prePO) commented:**

> For the `redeemHook`, once trading on the UniswapV3Pool is closed, we would most likely replace the `redeemHook` with one that does not have an `AccountList`, therefore allowing with existing positions to redeem them via the `PrePOMarket` contract.
> I understand that this person is highlighting that some people would be allowed to mint, but not redeem, but users do not mint positions anyway. They buy them from UniswapV3 Pools with `Collateral` that they mint. Liquidity on the pools is provided by the team, who are the only ones allowed to mint positions for a `PrePOMarket`.

**Picodes (judge) decreased severity to Medium and commented:**

> My decision will be to accept this finding but downgrade it to Medium, considering that:
> - the audited scope didn't contain a version of `redeemHook` without `AccountList`
> - if users don't mint but buy using Uniswap, they still cannot redeem if there is some form of whitelisting required
> - as highlighted by the sponsor the `AccountList` isn't supposed to be the same as the `mint` one
> - funds aren't lost but stuck until the governance updates the `AccountList`

### Notes & Impressions

#### Core Problem

The protocol allows two different authorization methods for deposits but only one for redemptions, creating a funds-trapping situation.

## [M-05] `PrePOMarket.setFinalLongPayout()` shouldn't be called twice.
----
- **Tags**: #business_logic 
- Number of finders: 4
- Difficulty: Medium
---
### Impact

If `finalLongPayout` is changed twice by admin fault, the market would be insolvent as it should pay more collateral than it has.
### Proof of Concept

If `finalLongPayout` is less than `MAX_PAYOUT`, it means the market is ended and 
`longToken Price = finalLongPayout`, 
`shortToken Price = MAX_PAYOUT - finalLongPayout`.

So when users redeem their `long/short` tokens, the total amount of collateral tokens will be the same as the amount that users transferred during `mint()`.

Btw in `setFinalLongPayout()`, there is no validation that this function can't be called twice and the below scenario would be possible.

1. Let's assume there is one user `Bob` in the market for simplicity.
2. `Bob` transferred 100 amounts of `collateral` and got 100 long/short tokens. The market has 100 `collateral`.
3. The market admin set `finalLongPayout = 60 * 1e16` and `Bob` redeemed 100 `longToken` and received 60 `collateral`. The market has 40 `collateral` now.
4. After that, the admin realized `finalLongPayout` is too high and changed `finalLongPayout = 40 * 1e16` again.
5. `Bob` tries to redeem 100 `shortToken` and receive 60 `collateral` but the market can't offer as it has 40 `collateral` only.
    
When there are several users in the market, some users can't redeem their long/short tokens as the market doesn't have enough `collaterals`.
### Recommended Mitigation

We should modify `setFinalLongPayout()` like below so it can't be finalized twice.

```
  function setFinalLongPayout(uint256 _finalLongPayout) external override onlyOwner { 
    require(finalLongPayout > MAX_PAYOUT, "Finalized already"); //++++++++++++++++++++++++

    require(_finalLongPayout >= floorLongPayout, "Payout cannot be below floor");
    require(_finalLongPayout <= ceilingLongPayout, "Payout cannot exceed ceiling");
    finalLongPayout = _finalLongPayout;
    emit FinalLongPayoutSet(_finalLongPayout);
  }
```
### Discussion

### Notes & Impressions

#### Understanding Token Minting in This System

First, let's clarify how the initial token minting works:

When a user deposits collateral into the system, they receive an equal number of both long and short tokens. This is because the system is designed as a prediction market where:

- Long tokens represent a bet that the outcome will be high
- Short tokens represent a bet that the outcome will be low

So if Bob deposits 100 collateral tokens, he receives:

- 100 long tokens
- 100 short tokens

The total is 200 tokens, but this doesn't mean he's getting extra value. The combined value of both token types will eventually equal his original deposit. Think of it as splitting his deposit into two different betting positions.

#### Detailed Example of the Vulnerability

Let's walk through a step-by-step example with actual values:

##### Initial Setup

- Let's assume `MAX_PAYOUT` is set to 1 × 10^18 (using 18 decimal places, which is common in many tokens)
- Bob deposits 100 collateral tokens
- Bob receives 100 long tokens and 100 short tokens
- The market contract now holds 100 collateral tokens

##### Market Resolution (First Time)

- The market event concludes
- The admin determines that the long position should be worth 60% of the maximum
- Admin calls `setFinalLongPayout(0.6 × 10^18)` (60% of MAX_PAYOUT)
- This means:
    - Each long token is now worth 0.6 collateral tokens
    - Each short token is worth 0.4 collateral tokens (MAX_PAYOUT - longPayout)

##### First Redemption

- Bob decides to redeem his 100 long tokens
- Calculation: 100 long tokens × 0.6 collateral per token = 60 collateral tokens
- Bob receives 60 collateral tokens
- The market contract now holds 40 collateral tokens (100 - 60 = 40)
- Bob still holds his 100 short tokens

##### Incorrect Second Market Resolution

- The admin realizes they made a mistake in the calculation
- Instead of 60%, the long position should have been worth 40%
- Admin calls `setFinalLongPayout(0.4 × 10^18)` again
- Now:
    - Each long token is newly valued at 0.4 collateral tokens
    - Each short token is newly valued at 0.6 collateral tokens

##### The Insolvency Problem

- Bob now tries to redeem his 100 short tokens
- Based on the new payout rates, Bob should receive:
    - 100 short tokens × 0.6 collateral per token = 60 collateral tokens
- However, the market contract only has 40 collateral tokens left
- The contract is now insolvent and cannot fulfill Bob's redemption

##### Mathematical Inconsistency

In a properly functioning market, the sum of all redemptions should equal the total collateral:

- Initial collateral: 100
- Expected total redemptions: 60 (for long) + 60 (for short) = 120
- This exceeds the available collateral by 20 tokens!

#### Why This Happens

The fundamental problem is that the token values were changed after redemption had already begun. The system is designed with the assumption that:

1. Long token value + Short token value = MAX_PAYOUT (a fixed constant)
2. This ensures that all the collateral that comes in will eventually go out

By changing the payout rates after redemptions started, this mathematical balance is broken, creating an impossible situation where more collateral is owed than is available.

#### The Fix Explained

The fix requires ensuring `setFinalLongPayout()` can only be called once. The proposed solution uses a clever check:

```solidity
require(finalLongPayout > MAX_PAYOUT, "Finalized already");
```

This works because:

1. Initially, `finalLongPayout` is set to a value greater than `MAX_PAYOUT` (probably as a default/uninitialized state)
2. When `setFinalLongPayout()` is called, it sets `finalLongPayout` to a value that must be ≤ `MAX_PAYOUT` (because of the ceiling check)
3. Therefore, after the first call, `finalLongPayout` will always be ≤ `MAX_PAYOUT`
4. Any subsequent call will fail the new requirement check

## [M-07] Users do not receive owed tokens if `TokenSender` contract cannot cover their owed amount.
----
- **Tags**: #business_logic 
- Number of finders: 5
- Difficulty: Medium\
---

The `TokenSender.send()` method is called during the course of users withdrawing or redeeming tokens from the protocol. The method is called via `DepositHook.hook()`, `RedeemHook.hook()`, and `WithdrawHook.hook()`. These in turn are called in `prePOMarket.redeem()` or `Collateral.deposit()|.withdraw()` ​ `TokenSender.send()` contains some logic to return early without sending any of the "outputToken", such as if the price of the outputToken has fallen below an adjustable lower bound, or if the amount would be 0. ​ However, it also checks its own balance to see if it can cover the required amount. If it cannot, it simply doesn't send tokens. These tokens are intended to be a compensation for fees paid elsewhere in the process, and thus do represent a value loss.

```solidity
function send(address recipient, uint256 unconvertedAmount) external override onlyAllowedMsgSenders { 
    uint256 scaledPrice = (_price.get() * _priceMultiplier) / MULTIPLIER_DENOMINATOR;
    if (scaledPrice <= _scaledPriceLowerBound) return; 
    uint256 outputAmount = (unconvertedAmount * _outputTokenDecimalsFactor) / scaledPrice;
    if (outputAmount == 0) return;
    if (outputAmount > _outputToken.balanceOf(address(this))) return; // don't send if not enough balance
    _outputToken.transfer(recipient, outputAmount);
}
```

The documentation in `ITokenSender.sol` states this is so the protocol doesn't halt the redeem and `deposit/withdraw` actions.

### Impact

The warden agrees that the protocol halting is generally undesirable.

​However, there isn't any facility in the code for the user who triggered the overage amount to be able to later receive their tokens when the contract is topped up. They must rely upon governance to send them any owed tokens. This increases centralization risks and isn't necessary. ​

Since the contract makes no attempt to track the tokens that should have been sent, manually reviewing and verifying owed tokens becomes a non-trivial task if any more than a handful of users were affected. ​

Since the user did receive their underlying collateral in any case and the loss isn't necessarily permanent, medium seems to be the right severity for this issue.

### Proof of Concept

​Bob wants to redeem his long and short tokens via `PrePOMarket.redeem()`. However, Alice's redemption prior to his, significantly drained the `TokenSender` contract of its tokens. As a result, Bob's redemption fails to benefit him in the amount of the outputToken he should have received in compensation for the fees paid.

Because the quantity of tokens paid to Bob is partially dependent upon the token's price at the time of redemption, the protocol might shoulder more downside loss (token price dropped compared to when Bob redeemed, must pay out more tokens) or Bob might suffer upside loss (price went up compared to time of redemption, Bob loses the difference). ​

Bob's recourse is to contact the project administrators and try to have his tokens sent to him manually. Agreeing to a value adds friction to the process.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

​ The `TokenSender` contract should track users whose balance wasn't covered in a mapping, as well as a function for them to manually claim tokens later on if the contract's balance is topped up.

Such a function might record the price at redemption time, or it might calculate it with the current price.
### Discussion

**Picodes (judge) commented:**

> In my understanding, if the refunds are all used, they aren't owed anything and pay the regular fees. The design seems to be that there is a way to give temporary discounts or fee refunds but it is not mandatory.

**ramenforbreakfast (prePO) disagreed with severity and commented:**

> I believe this issue is a duplicate of [#311](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-prepo-findings/issues/311), although this one is more fleshed out and would consider as the primary issue. I agree with lowering this to QA since there is no expectation of rewards, and the frontend would be able to reliably inform the user whether they would receive a rebate, nothing is being misrepresented on-chain. Token rewards are only a possible incentive, not an owed liability, to users.

**Picodes (judge) commented:**

> The front-end cannot properly mitigate the possibility of front running and someone taking all the available rebates before a user transaction. Therefore, in my opinion, due to the lack of safety checks, Medium severity is appropriate as a user could think he'd receive a rebate but won't receive it.

### Notes & Impressions

*The `TokenSender` contract silently fails when it lacks sufficient tokens to pay user rebates, without tracking unpaid amounts or providing a mechanism for users to claim them later.*
