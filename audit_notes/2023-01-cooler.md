## [H-02] Loans can be rolled an unlimited number of times
----

- Number of finders: 15

### Summary

Loans can be rolled an unlimited number of times, without letting the lender decide if has been done too many times already

### Vulnerability Detail

The lender is expected to be able to toggle whether a loan can be rolled or not, but once it's enabled, there is no way to prevent the borrower from rolling an unlimited number of times in the same transaction or in quick succession.

### Impact

If the lender is giving an interest-free loan and assumes that allowing a roll will only extend the term by one, they'll potentially be forced to wait until the end of the universe if the borrower chooses to roll an excessive number of times.

If the borrower is using a quickly-depreciating collateral, the lender may be happy to allow one a one-term extension, but will lose money if the term is rolled multiple times and the borrower defaults thereafter.

The initial value of `loan.rollable` is always `true`, so unless the lender calls `toggleRoll()` in the same transaction that they call `clear()`, a determined attacker will be able to roll as many times as they wish.

### Code Snippet

As long as the borrower is willing to pay the interest up front, they can call `roll()` any number of times, extending the duration of the total loan to however long they wish:

```solidity
// File: src/Cooler.sol : Cooler.roll()   #1

129        function roll (uint256 loanID) external {
130            Loan storage loan = loans[loanID];
131            Request memory req = loan.request;
132    
133            if (block.timestamp > loan.expiry) 
134                revert Default();
135    
136            if (!loan.rollable)
137                revert NotRollable();
138    
139            uint256 newCollateral = collateralFor(loan.amount, req.loanToCollateral) - loan.collateral;
140            uint256 newDebt = interestFor(loan.amount, req.interest, req.duration);
141    
142            loan.amount += newDebt;
143            loan.expiry += req.duration;
144            loan.collateral += newCollateral;
145            
146            collateral.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), newCollateral);
147:       }
```

[toggleRoll()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-cooler/blob/main/src/Cooler.sol#L185-L193) can't be used to stop rolls if they're all done in a single transaction.

```solidity
    function toggleRoll(uint256 loanID) external returns (bool) {
        Loan storage loan = loans[loanID];


        if (msg.sender != loan.lender)
            revert OnlyApproved();


        loan.rollable = !loan.rollable;
        return loan.rollable;
    }
```
## Recommendation

Have a variable controlling the number of rolls the lender is allowing, and or only allow a roll if the current `block.timestamp` is within one `req.duration` of the current `loan.expiry`

### Notes

#### Notes 

- **Issue:** Even if a lender allows rolling, there's no cap on the number of times a borrower can roll the loan. This could lead to indefinite extensions, especially problematic with depreciating collateral.
    
- **Root Cause:** Missing logic to limit the number of rolls once `rollable` is true.

H-02 deals with the absence of roll limits post-enablement, while M-02 concerns the initial default state. They are separate issues.

## [H-03] Fully repaying a loan will result in debt payment being lost
----
- **Tags**: #configuration #business_logic 
- Number of finders: 10
- Difficulty: Medium
---
### Summary

When a `loan` is fully repaid the `loan` storage is deleted. Since `loan` is a `storage` reference to the loan, `loan.lender` will return `address(0)` after the `loan` has been deleted. This will result in the `debt` being transferred to `address(0)` instead of the lender. Some ERC20 tokens will revert when being sent to `address(0)` but a large number will simply be sent there and lost forever.

### Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
function repay (uint256 loanID, uint256 repaid) external {
    Loan storage loan = loans[loanID];

    if (block.timestamp > loan.expiry) 
        revert Default();
    
    uint256 decollateralized = loan.collateral * repaid / loan.amount;

    if (repaid == loan.amount) delete loans[loanID];
    else {
        loan.amount -= repaid;
        loan.collateral -= decollateralized;
    }

    debt.transferFrom(msg.sender, loan.lender, repaid);
    collateral.transfer(owner, decollateralized);
}
```

In `Cooler#repay` the loan storage associated with the loanID being repaid is deleted. `loan` is a storage reference so when `loans[loanID]` is deleted so is `loan`. The result is that `loan.lender` is now `address(0)` and the loan payment will be sent there instead.

### Impact

Lender's funds are sent to `address(0)`
### Recommended Mitigation

Send collateral/debt then delete:

```solidity
-   if (repaid == loan.amount) delete loans[loanID];
+   if (repaid == loan.amount) {
+       debt.transferFrom(msg.sender, loan.lender, loan.amount);
+       collateral.transfer(owner, loan.collateral);
+       delete loans[loanID];
+       return;
+   }
```

### Discussion

### Notes

#### Notes 

- Danger of `delete` on Structs
	- In Solidity, when you delete a struct from storage, all its fields are reset to their default values. So loan.lender becomes address(0) because that's the default for address types.
- Funds First, Delete Last
	- **Always finalize financial transactions** _before_ modifying or deleting state variables they depend on.

## [M-02] Loan is rollable by default
----
- **Tags**: #Initialization #business_logic 
- Number of finders: 13
- Difficulty: Medium
---
### Summary

Making the loan rollable by default gives an unfair early advantage to the borrowers.

### Vulnerability Detail

When clearing a new loan, the flag of `rollable` is set to true by default:

```solidity
    loans.push(
        Loan(req, req.amount + interest, collat, expiration, true, msg.sender)
    );
```

This means a borrower can extend the loan anytime before the expiry:

```solidity
    function roll (uint256 loanID) external {
        Loan storage loan = loans[loanID];
        Request memory req = loan.request;

        if (block.timestamp > loan.expiry) 
            revert Default();

        if (!loan.rollable)
            revert NotRollable();
```

If the lenders do not intend to allow rollable loans, they should separately toggle the status to prevent that:

```solidity
    function toggleRoll(uint256 loanID) external returns (bool) {
        ...
        loan.rollable = !loan.rollable;
        ...
    }
```

I believe it gives an unfair advantage to the borrower because they can re-roll the loan before the lender's transaction forbids this action.
### Impact

Lenders who do not want the loans to be used more than once, have to bundle their transactions. Otherwise, it is possible that someone might roll their loan, especially if the capital requirements are not huge because anyone can roll any loan.

### Recommendation

I believe `rollable` should be set to false by default or at least add an extra function parameter to determine the initial value of this status.

## [M-04] Dust amounts can cause payments to fail, leading to default

- Number of finders: 4
- Difficulty: Medium
---
### Summary

Dust amounts can cause payments to fail, leading to default

### Vulnerability Detail

In order for a loan to close, the exact right number of `wei` of the debt token must be sent to match the remaining loan amount. If more is sent, the balance underflows, reverting the transaction.
### Impact

An attacker can send dust amounts right before a loan is due, front-running any payments also destined for the final block before default. If the attacker's transaction goes in first, the borrower will be unable to pay back the loan before default, and will lose their remaining collateral. This may be the whole loan amount.
### Code Snippet

If the repayment amount isn't exactly the remaining loan amount, and instead is more (due to the dust payment), the subtraction marked below will underflow, reverting the payment:

```solidity
// File: src/Cooler.sol : Cooler.repay()   #1

108        function repay (uint256 loanID, uint256 repaid) external {
109            Loan storage loan = loans[loanID];
110    
111            if (block.timestamp > loan.expiry) 
112                revert Default();
113            
114            uint256 decollateralized = loan.collateral * repaid / loan.amount;
115    
116           if (repaid == loan.amount) delete loans[loanID];
117           else {
118 @>             loan.amount -= repaid;
119                loan.collateral -= decollateralized;
120            }
121    
122            debt.transferFrom(msg.sender, loan.lender, repaid);
123            collateral.transfer(owner, decollateralized);
124:       }
```
### ### Recommendation

Only collect and subtract the minimum of the current loan balance, and the amount specified in the `repaid` variable
### Discussion

> Good spot. Niche case.

### Notes & Impressions

#### Notes 

1. Anyone can call `repay` the loan. Borrowers may need flexibility to repay loans.
2. Underflow: `repaid` can not be greater than `loan.amount`
3. front-run dust attack

#### Impressions

Repayments **cannot exceed the remaining loan balance**
