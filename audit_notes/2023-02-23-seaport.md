### Description
When `Seaport` is called to `fulfill` or match a collection of (advanced) orders, the `OrderFulfilled` is called before applying fulfillments and executing transfers. The offer and consideration items have the following forms:

$$
C=\left(I_t, T, i, a_{\text {curr }}, R, a_{\text {curr }}\right)
$$

$$
O=\left(I_t, T, i, a_{\text {curr }},a_{\text {curr }}\right)
$$

The `SpentItems` and `ReceivedItem` items provided to `OrderFulfilled` event ignore the last component of the `offer/consideration` items in the above form since they are redundant. 

`Seaport` enforces that all consideration items are used. But for the endpoints in this context, we might end up with offer items with only a portion of their amounts being spent. So in the end $O.a_{curr}$ might not be the amount spent for this offer item, but `OrderFulfilled` emits $O.a_{curr}$ as the amount spent. This can cause discrepancies in off-chain bookkeeping by agents listening for this event. 

The `fulfillOrder` and `fulfillAdvancedOrder` do not have this issue, since all items are enforced to be used. These two endpoints also differ from when there are collections of (advanced) orders, in that they would emit the `OrderFulfilled` at the of their call before clearing the reentrancy guard. 

### Recommendation: 

Make sure the accounting is updated to only provide the spent offer item amounts to `OrderFulfilled`. Moving the emission of this event to the end of the call flow, before clearing the reentrancy guard like the above mentioned simpler endpoint would make it easier to provide the correct values (and also would make the whole flow between different endpoints more consistent and potentially create an opportunity to refactor the codebase further). 
### Discussion

**Seaport**: Fixed in PR 839 by making sure all unspent offer amounts are transferred to the recipient provided by the `msg.sender`. 

```solidity
// Get the offer items from the order parameters
OfferItem[] memory offer = parameters.offer;

// Store the total number of offer items for efficiency
uint256 totalOfferItems = offer.length;

// Process each offer item to handle any unspent amounts
for (uint256 j = 0; j < totalOfferItems; ++j) {
    OfferItem memory offerItem = offer[j];
    
    // originalAmount represents what was initially offered
    uint256 originalAmount = offerItem.endAmount;
    
    // unspentAmount represents what wasn't used in the trade
    uint256 unspentAmount = offerItem.startAmount;

    // If there's any unspent amount, transfer it to the recipient
    if (unspentAmount != 0) {
        _transfer(
            _convertOfferItemToReceivedItemWithRecipient(
                offerItem,
                _recipient
            ),
            parameters.offerer,
            parameters.conduitKey,
            accumulator
        );
    }

    // Restore the original amount for accurate event emission
    offerItem.startAmount = originalAmount;
}
```

**Spearbit**: Verified.

### Notes & Impressions

#### Notes 
When the protocol emits the `OrderFulfilled` event for collection orders, it reports the full amount from the offer, even if only a portion of that offer was actually used in the transaction

## [M-03] Empty `criteriaResolvers` for criteria-based contract orders
----
- **Tags**: #business_logic #validation #bait_and_switch
- Number of finders: 4
- Difficulty: Medium

### Description

There is a deviation in how criteria-based items are resolved for contract orders. For contract orders which have offers with criteria, the `_compareItems` function checks that the contract offerer returned a corresponding non-criteria based `itemType` when `identifierOrCriteria` for the original item is `0`, i.e., offering from an entire collection. Afterwards, the `orderParameters.offer` array is replaced by the `offer` array returned by the contract offerer. 
[lib/OrderValidator.sol#L312-L315](https://github.com/ProjectOpenSea/seaport/blob/8d95af1a952ac0ebf784e323e5e1a2b5d687cc4f/contracts/lib/OrderValidator.sol#L312-L315)
```solidity
    function _compareItems(
        MemoryPointer originalItem,
        MemoryPointer newItem
    ) internal pure returns (uint256 isInvalid) {
    ... ...
            if and(gt(itemType, 3), iszero(identifier)) {
                // replace item type
                itemType := sub(3, eq(itemType, 4))
                identifier := mload(add(newItem, Common_identifier_offset))
```

[lib/OrderValidator.sol#L434](https://github.com/ProjectOpenSea/seaport/blob/8d95af1a952ac0ebf784e323e5e1a2b5d687cc4f/contracts/lib/OrderValidator.sol#L434)
```solidity
            orderParameters.offer = offer;  // replaced by offer
```

For other criteria-based orders such as offers with `identifierOrCriteria = 0`, the `itemType` of the order is only updated during the criteria resolution step. 
[lib/CriteriaResolution.sol#L119](https://github.com/ProjectOpenSea/seaport/blob/8d95af1a952ac0ebf784e323e5e1a2b5d687cc4f/contracts/lib/CriteriaResolution.sol#L119)
```solidity
    function _applyCriteriaResolvers(
        AdvancedOrder[] memory advancedOrders,
        CriteriaResolver[] memory criteriaResolvers
    ) internal pure {
   ... ...
                    _updateCriteriaItem(.  // criteria solution step
```

This means that for such offers there should be a corresponding `CriteriaResolver` struct. See the following test:

        ]; 
        
        const { order, orderHash, value } = await createOrder(
```

However, in case of contract offers with `identifierOrCriteria = 0`, Seaport 1.2 does not expect a corresponding `CriteriaResolver` struct and will revert if one is provided as the `itemType` was updated to be the corresponding non-criteria based `itemType`. See `advanced.spec.ts#L510` for a test case. 
[itemType](https://github.com/ProjectOpenSea/seaport/blob/8d95af1a952ac0ebf784e323e5e1a2b5d687cc4f/contracts/lib/CriteriaResolution.sol#L192)
```solidity
        // Ensure the specified item type indicates criteria usage.
        if (!_isItemWithCriteria(itemType)) {
            _revertCriteriaNotEnabledForItem();
        }
```

*Note*: this also means that the fulfiller cannot explicitly provide the identifier when a contract order is being fulfilled. 

A malicious contract may use this to their advantage. For example, assume that a contract offerer in Seaport only accepts criteria-based offers. The fulfiller may first call `previewOrder` where the criteria is always resolved to a rare NFT, but the actual execution would return an uninteresting NFT. If such offers also required a corresponding resolver (similar behaviour as regular criteria based orders), then this could be fixed by explicitly providing the `identifier--`akin to a slippage check. 

In short, for regular criteria-based orders with `identifierOrCriteria = 0` the fulfiller can pick which `identifier` to receive by providing a `CriteriaResolver` (as long as it's valid). For contract orders, fulfillers don't have this option and contracts may be able to abuse this. 

### Recommendation: 
An alternative approach to criteria-based contract orders would be to remove the extra case in `_compareItems`. Now, contract offers will have to return the same `itemType` and `identifierOrCriteria` when a `generateOrder` call is made. However, this means that the fulfiller will be able to choose the `identifier` it wants to receive. This may not be the ideal in some cases, but it remains consistent with regular orders. 

### Discussion
Seaport: We documented this deviation in PR 849. 
Spearbit: Verified
### Notes & Impressions

#### Notes 
- When someone checks the order preview (`previewOrder`), the contract shows it will give a valuable, rare NFT
- But when the actual order executes, it gives a different, less valuable NFT
- Because fulfillers can't provide a CriteriaResolver for contract orders, they have no way to ensure they get the specific NFT they saw in the preview

#### Impressions
"bait and switch" scenario
>*"Bait and switch" is a deceptive marketing tactic in which a seller advertises a product or service at a very low price (the "bait") to attract customers, but then tries to convince them to buy a more expensive product or service (the "switch").*
