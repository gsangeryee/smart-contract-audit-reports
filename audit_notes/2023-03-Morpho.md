### Description

Currently, when a market must be deprecated, Morpho checks that borrowing has been paused before applying the new value for the flag.

[aave-v2/MorphoGovernance.sol#L358-L366](https://github.com/morpho-org/morpho-optimizers/blob/4810ba9830d606430a9cb93936da69753556502e/src/aave-v2/MorphoGovernance.sol#L358-L366) and [compound/MorphoGovernance.sol#L368-L376](https://github.com/morpho-org/morpho-optimizers/blob/4810ba9830d606430a9cb93936da69753556502e/src/compound/MorphoGovernance.sol#L368-L376)
```solidity
    function setIsDeprecated(address _poolToken, bool _isDeprecated)
        external
        onlyOwner
        isMarketCreated(_poolToken)
    {
        if (!marketPauseStatus[_poolToken].isBorrowPaused) revert BorrowNotPaused();
        marketPauseStatus[_poolToken].isDeprecated = _isDeprecated;
        emit IsDeprecatedSet(_poolToken, _isDeprecated);
    }
```

The same check should be done in `isLiquidateBorrowPaused`, allowing the deprecation of a market only if `isLiquidateBorrowPaused == false` otherwise liquidators would not be able to liquidate borrowers on a deprecated market.
### Recommended Mitigation

Prevent the deprecation of a market if the `isLiquidateBorrowPaused` flag is set to true. 

Consider also checking the `isDeprecated` flag in the `setIsLiquidateBorrowPaused` to prevent pausing the liquidation if the market is deprecated. If Morpho implements the specific behavior should also be aware of the issue described in "*`setIsPausedForAllMarkets` bypass the check done in `setIsBorrowPaused` and allow resuming borrow on a deprecated market*".

Example:
```solidity
function setIsDeprecated(address _poolToken, bool _isDeprecated)
    external
    onlyOwner
    isMarketCreated(_poolToken)
{
    if (!marketPauseStatus[_poolToken].isBorrowPaused) revert BorrowNotPaused();
    // Add new check
    if (marketPauseStatus[_poolToken].isLiquidateBorrowPaused) revert LiquidationsPaused();
    marketPauseStatus[_poolToken].isDeprecated = _isDeprecated;
    emit IsDeprecatedSet(_poolToken, _isDeprecated);
}
```

### Discussion

Morpho: We acknowledge this issue. The reason behind this is the following: given what @MathisGD said, if we want to be consistent we should prevent pausing the liquidation borrow on a deprecated asset. However, there might be an issue (we don't know) with the liquidation borrow and the operator would not be able to pause it. For this reason, we prefer to leave things as it is. 

Spearbit: Acknowledged.

### Notes & Impressions

#### Notes 
First, let's understand what these mechanisms do:

1. Market Deprecation: When a market needs to be shut down or retired, it can be "deprecated." This is typically done when there are issues with the market or it needs to be phased out.
2. Liquidation Pausing: The protocol has the ability to pause liquidations through the `isLiquidateBorrowPaused` flag. This is usually a temporary measure for maintenance or emergency situations.

The issue arises because there's no similar check for the liquidation status. This means a market could be deprecated while liquidations are paused (`isLiquidateBorrowPaused = true`). This creates a dangerous situation where:

1. The market is deprecated (meaning it should be wound down)
2. There might be borrowers who need to be liquidated to maintain system health
3. But liquidators cannot perform liquidations because they're paused
#### Impressions

**Key Points**
- Market Status (Deprecated/Closed)
    - Interaction restrictions
    - Order of operations during deprecation
    - Proper cleanup mechanisms
- Liquidation Status
    - Pause/unpause conditions
    - Emergency controls
    - Impact on protocol solvency
- Additional Critical Areas:
    - State transitions between market statuses
    - Oracle price feed reliability
    - Collateral value calculations
    - Fee mechanisms during market changes
    - Access control for status changes
    - Event emissions for status changes

## [M-3] User `withdrawals` can fail if Morpho position is close to liquidation
----
- **Tags**: #Denial_of_Service #business_logic 
- Number of finders: 4
- Difficulty: Medium
---
### Description

When trying to withdraw funds from Morpho as a P2P supplier the last step of the withdrawal algorithm borrows an amount from the pool ("hard withdraw"). If the Morpho position on Aave's debt / collateral value is higher than the market's max LTV ratio but lower than the market's liquidation threshold, the borrow will fail and the position can also not be liquidated. The withdrawals could fail.
### Proof of Concept

[ExitPositionsManager.sol#L468](https://github.com/morpho-org/morpho-optimizers/blob/5f39e0d197830dbd4ede7f1657973a56f7e21232/contracts/aave-v2/ExitPositionsManager.sol#L468)
```solidity
    function _unsafeWithdrawLogic(
        address _poolToken,
        uint256 _amount,
        address _supplier,
        address _receiver,
        uint256 _maxGasForMatching
    ) internal {
......
        // Demote peer-to-peer borrowers.
        if (vars.remainingToWithdraw > 0) {
            uint256 unmatched = _unmatchBorrowers(
                _poolToken,
                vars.remainingToWithdraw,
                vars.remainingGasForMatching
            );

            // Increase the peer-to-peer borrow delta.
            if (unmatched < vars.remainingToWithdraw) {
                delta.p2pBorrowDelta += (vars.remainingToWithdraw - unmatched).rayDiv(
                    poolIndexes[_poolToken].poolBorrowIndex
                );
                emit P2PBorrowDeltaUpdated(_poolToken, delta.p2pBorrowDelta);
            }

            delta.p2pSupplyAmount -= Math.min(
                delta.p2pSupplyAmount,
                vars.remainingToWithdraw.rayDiv(vars.p2pSupplyIndex)
            );
            delta.p2pBorrowAmount -= Math.min(
                delta.p2pBorrowAmount,
                unmatched.rayDiv(p2pBorrowIndex[_poolToken])
            );
            emit P2PAmountsUpdated(_poolToken, delta.p2pSupplyAmount, delta.p2pBorrowAmount);

            _borrowFromPool(underlyingToken, vars.remainingToWithdraw); // Reverts on error.
        }
......
```

### Recommended Mitigation

This seems hard to solve in the current system as it relies on the "hard withdraws" to always ensure enough liquidity for P2P suppliers. Consider ways to mitigate the impact of this problem.

### Discussion

Morpho: Since Morpho will first launch on Compound (where there is only Collateral Factor), we will not focus now on this particular issue. 
Spearbit: Acknowledged.
### Notes & Impressions

#### Notes 
- Maximum LTV(Loan-to-Value ) ratio - The maximum amount you can borrow against your collateral
- Liquidation threshold: The point at which your position becomes eligible for liquidation

Imagine Aave has these parameters:
- Maximum LTV: 80%
- Liquidation threshold: 85%
This creates three possible zones for a lending position:
```
Safe Zone (LTV < 80%):
- Can borrow more
- Cannot be liquidated
- Normal operations

Danger Zone (80% < LTV < 85%): <- This is where our problem occurs
- Cannot borrow more
- Cannot be liquidated yet
- Position is stuck!

Liquidation Zone (LTV > 85%):
- Cannot borrow more
- Can be liquidated
- Position at risk
```

The scenario of withdrawals fail in the "Danger Zone"
- When a user requests a withdrawal from Morpho, and there isn't enough peer-to-peer liquidity, Morpho needs to borrow from Aave to fulfill the withdrawal (this is the "hard withdraw").
- But if Morpho's position is already in the Danger Zone (say at 82% LTV):
    - Morpho can't borrow more because it's above the max LTV (80%)
    - The position can't be liquidated because it hasn't reached the liquidation threshold (85%)
    - Therefore, there's no way to get the additional funds needed for the withdrawal
#### Impressions
- Pay attention to withdraw operations,
- Monitor the maximum LTV ratio,
- Be mindful of the liquidation threshold.

## [M-13] `claimToTreasury`(COMP) steals users' COMP rewards
----
- **Tags**: #Deposit_or_Reward_tokens #business_logic 
- Number of finders: 5
- Difficulty: Medium
---
### Description

The `claimToTreasury` function can send a market's underlying tokens that have been accumulated in the contract to the treasury. This is intended to be used for the reserve amounts that accumulate in the contract from P2P matches. However, Compound also pays out rewards in COMP and COMP is a valid Compound market. Sending the COMP reserves will also send the COMP rewards. This is especially bad as anyone can claim COMP rewards on the behalf of Morpho at any time and the rewards will be sent to the contract. An attacker could even front run a `claimToTreasury(cCOMP)` call with a `Comptroller.claimComp`(morpho, [cComp]) call to sabotage the reward system. Users won't be able to claim their rewards.

[compound/MorphoGovernance.sol#L399C1-L423C6](https://github.com/morpho-org/morpho-optimizers/blob/5f39e0d197830dbd4ede7f1657973a56f7e21232/contracts/compound/MorphoGovernance.sol#L399C1-L423C6)
```solidity
    function claimToTreasury(address[] calldata _poolTokens, uint256[] calldata _amounts)
        external
        onlyOwner
    {
        if (treasuryVault == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress();

        uint256 numberOfMarkets = _poolTokens.length;

        for (uint256 i; i < numberOfMarkets; ++i) {
            address poolToken = _poolTokens[i];

            Types.MarketStatus memory status = marketStatus[poolToken];
            if (!status.isCreated) continue;

            ERC20 underlyingToken = _getUnderlying(poolToken);
            uint256 underlyingBalance = underlyingToken.balanceOf(address(this)); //steals users rewards.

            if (underlyingBalance == 0) continue;

            uint256 toClaim = Math.min(_amounts[i], underlyingBalance);

            underlyingToken.safeTransfer(treasuryVault, toClaim);
            emit ReserveFeeClaimed(poolToken, toClaim);
        }
    }
```
### Recommended Mitigation

If Morpho wants to support the COMP market, consider separating the COMP reserve from the COMP rewards.
### Discussion

Morpho: Given the changes to do and the small likelihood to set a reserve factor for the COMP asset and the awareness on our side about this, we decided not to implement it. 

Spearbit: Acknowledged.
### Notes & Impressions

#### Notes 
This issue is indeed specifically related to unique characteristics of the COMP market, but in a somewhat indirect way. Let me explain why:

COMP has two special characteristics that make this situation unique:

1. COMP tokens are distributed as rewards to users of Compound protocol
2. COMP itself can be used as a market asset (cCOMP) within Compound

The core issue arises from the intersection of these characteristics with Morpho's `claimToTreasury` function. When this function is called for the COMP market, it can't distinguish between two different types of COMP tokens in the contract:

- COMP tokens that are legitimate reserves from P2P matches (which should go to treasury)
- COMP tokens that are rewards earned by users (which should go to the users)
#### Impressions

*This single balance check doesn't differentiate between reserves and rewards, which is problematic specifically because COMP serves both purposes simultaneously.*
