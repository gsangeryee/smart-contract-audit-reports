### Description:

When calculating pending liquidity position fees, **liquidity, tokensOwed0, and tokensOwed1**  are read from a Uniswap V3 pool using a position belonging to the  `NonfungiblePositionManager` contract. 

However, the read values will also include the liquidity and the owed token amounts of all Uniswap V3 users who deposited funds in the price range of the position via the `NonfungiblePositionManager` contract. 

Since  `NonfungiblePositionManager` manages positions in pools on behalf of users, the positions will  hold liquidity of all `NonfungiblePositionManager` users. 

As a result, the PnL of  `UniswapV3Strategy` positions may be significantly increased, resulting in increased payouts to lenders and loss of funds to `borrowers/liquidators`.

### Proof of Concept


### Recommended Mitigation

Consider reading the values of liquidity, **tokensOwed0, and tokensOwed1** from the  
`IUniswapV3NPM(uniV3NPM).positions()` call on line 95. The call returns values specifically for  
the position identified by the token ID.
