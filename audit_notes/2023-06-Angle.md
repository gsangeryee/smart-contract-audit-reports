## [H-03] Poor detection of disputed trees allows claiming tokens from a disputed tree

### Code

```solidity
    function getMerkleRoot() public view returns (bytes32) {
        if (block.timestamp >= endOfDisputePeriod) return tree.merkleRoot;
        else return lastTree.merkleRoot;
    }
```

Users can claim rewards from a Merkle tree that's being disputed. This can potentially lead to loss of funds since a malicious trusted EOA can claim funds from a malicious tree while it's being disputed.
### Proof of Concept

The [Distribution.getMerkleRoot](https://github.com/AngleProtocol/merkl-contracts/blob/1825925daef8b22d9d6c0a2bc7aab3309342e786/contracts/Distributor.sol#L199) function is used to get the current Merkle root during claiming. The function is aware of the dispute period of the current root and returns the previous root if the current tree is still in the dispute period.

[Distributor.getMerkleRoot](https://github.com/AngleProtocol/merkl-contracts/blob/1825925daef8b22d9d6c0a2bc7aab3309342e786/contracts/Distributor.sol#L200)
```solidity
    /// @notice Returns the MerkleRoot that is currently live for the contract
    function getMerkleRoot() public view returns (bytes32) {
        if (block.timestamp >= endOfDisputePeriod) return tree.merkleRoot;
        else return lastTree.merkleRoot;
    }
```

However, the function doesn't take into account the situation when:

1. a tree was disputed (i.e. [the disputer address is set](https://github.com/AngleProtocol/merkl-contracts/blob/1825925daef8b22d9d6c0a2bc7aab3309342e786/contracts/Distributor.sol#L237));
    
2. and the dispute period has finished (i.e. when `block.timestamp >= endOfDisputePeriod`).
    
[the disputer address is set](https://github.com/AngleProtocol/merkl-contracts/blob/1825925daef8b22d9d6c0a2bc7aab3309342e786/contracts/Distributor.sol#L237)
```solidity
    function disputeTree(string memory reason) external {
        if (block.timestamp >= endOfDisputePeriod) revert InvalidDispute();
        IERC20(disputeToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), disputeAmount);
        disputer = msg.sender; //he disputer address is set
        emit Disputed(reason);
    }
```

Such situations can happen realistically when a tree is disputed closer to the end of its dispute period and/or when the governor/guardian takes longer time to resolve the dispute. In such situations, the dispute period checks in the above functions will pass, however the `disputer` address will be set, which means that the tree is being disputed and shouldn't be used in claims.

As an example exploit scenario, a malicious trusted EOA can add a Merkle tree root that lets them claim the entire balance of the contract. Even if the tree gets disputed quickly, the success of the attack boils down to how quickly the governor/guardian will resolve the dispute. To increase the chance, the attack can be deliberately executed when the governor/guardian are not active or available immediately.
### Recommended Mitigation

When the `disputer` address is set (after a call to `disputeTree`), consider treating the current tree as disputed, no matter whether the dispute period has passed or not. E.g. consider these changes:

```solidity
diff --git a/contracts/Distributor.sol b/contracts/Distributor.sol
index bc4e49f..8fb6a4c 100644
--- a/contracts/Distributor.sol
+++ b/contracts/Distributor.sol

+        if (block.timestamp >= endOfDisputePeriod && disputer == address(0)) return tree.merkleRoot;
         else return lastTree.merkleRoot;
     }

```
