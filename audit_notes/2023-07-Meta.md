### Description

After the `mUSDManager` calls the `notifyRewardAmount()` function, the rewards are tracked using the `unclaimedRewards` variable when there are no stakers yet.

```solidity
function notifyRewardAmount(uint amount) external {
	require(msg.sender == address(mUSDManager), "Fund: Invalid caller");
	if (totalStaked() == 0) {
		/**
		* These rewards are unclaimable by the users
		* these tokens are forever locked in the contract
		* Happens if esMETA balance is zero
		*  a) When dApp - launched before IDO
		*  b) When circulation of esMETA is zero (rare-event)
		*/
		unclaimedRewards += amount;//@audit should track with shares
		return;
	}
	require(amount > 0, "amount = 0");
	uint256 share = mUSD.getSharesByMintedMUSD(amount);
	rewardPerTokenStored = rewardPerTokenStored + (share * Constants.PINT) / totalStaked();
}
	
function withdrawToTreasury() external onlyOwner {
	require(unclaimedRewards > 0, "Fund: No locked rewards");
	IERC20 _mUSD = IERC20(address(mUSD));
	_mUSD.transfer(treasury, unclaimedRewards); //@audit should transfer shares
	unclaimedRewards = 0;
}
```

When the owner withdraws the unclaimed rewards using `withdrawToTreasury()`, it transfers the mUSD amounts.

But `mUSD._transfer()` works with the shares and the ratio between shares and amounts might be changed at any time.

```solidity
function _transfer(address _sender, address _recipient, uint256 _amount) internal virtual {
	uint256 _sharesToTransfer = getSharesByMintedMUSD(_amount);
	_transferShares(_sender, _recipient, _sharesToTransfer);
	emit Transfer(_sender, _recipient, _amount);
	emit TransferShares(_sender, _recipient, _sharesToTransfer);
}
```

So during the withdrawal of unclaimed rewards, more or less mUSD than the expected amount might be withdrawn.

**Impact**  
Some rewards might be locked inside the contract or stakers might fail to claim the rewards as the contract doesn't have enough rewards. Because the stakers' rewards wouldn't be preserved inside the contract without any additional assumptions, I evaluate the severity to High.

**Recommendation:**  
`unclaimedRewards` should be tracked with shares.

```solidity
function notifyRewardAmount(uint amount) external {
	require(msg.sender == address(mUSDManager), "Fund: Invalid caller");
	if (totalStaked() == 0) {
		/**
		* These rewards are unclaimable by the users
		* these tokens are forever locked in the contract
		* Happens if esMETA balance is zero
		*  a) When dApp - launched before IDO
		*  b) When circulation of esMETA is zero (rare-event)
		*/
		unclaimedRewards += mUSD.getSharesByMintedMUSD(amount); //@audit add shares
		return;
	}
	require(amount > 0, "amount = 0");
	uint256 share = mUSD.getSharesByMintedMUSD(amount);
	rewardPerTokenStored = rewardPerTokenStored + (share * Constants.PINT) / totalStaked();
}

function withdrawToTreasury() external onlyOwner {
	require(unclaimedRewards > 0, "Fund: No locked rewards");
	IERC20 _mUSD = IERC20(address(mUSD));
	_mUSD.transferShares(treasury, unclaimedRewards); //@audit transfer shares
	unclaimedRewards = 0;
}
```

**Meta Team:**

Issue is fixed. Unclaimed rewards are handled in shares for consistency of accounting and transfers.

		+           unclaimedRewards += mUSD.getSharesByMintedMUSD(amount);
		return;
		}
		require(amount > 0, "amount = 0");
		uint256 share = mUSD.getSharesByMintedMUSD(amount);
		rewardPerTokenStored = rewardPerTokenStored + (share * Constants.PINT) / totalStaked();
	}

function withdrawToTreasury() external onlyOwner {
	require(unclaimedRewards > 0, "Fund: No unclaimed rewards");
	+       mUSD.transferShares(treasury, unclaimedRewards);
	unclaimedRewards = 0;
}
```
