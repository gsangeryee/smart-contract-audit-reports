*Summary from typical issues.*
# Typical Common Issues

- Check all code related to funds
- Check the updates of states  
	- Correctness of the update.
	- Whether all updates have been made.
	- [[2023-02-astaria#[H-03] `VaultImplementation.buyoutLien` does not update the new public vault's parameters and does not transfer assets between the vault and the borrower|[H-03] `VaultImplementation.buyoutLien` does not update the new public vault's parameters and does not transfer assets between the vault and the borrower]]
- Check multiplications calculations are stored in limited-size integers
- Precision Loss and  Insufficient Precision
	- Always be aware of the potential loss of precision caused by division operations.
	- Pay special attention to all calculation logics involving division during auditing.
	- Hidden "division before a multiplication"
		- Track the **complete** calculation process of variables
- Compare similar functions
	1. **Cross-contract Comparisons**: Compare related contracts for inconsistencies in key functionalities.
	2. **Key Functions**: Focus on critical operations such as `withdraw`, `deposit`, or similar sensitive actions.
	3. **Validation Checks**: Look for missing or inconsistent validations, especially regarding access control or permissions.
-  Data Validation 
	- Verifying input parameter constraints
	- Checking for proper data range and type validations
- edge cases
	- full-byte parameters
	- `new ExpirationPeriod window < current time < new ExpirationPeriod window`  - [[2024-10-kleidi#[M-03] `UpdateExpirationPeriod()` cannot be executed when the `newExpirationPeriod` is less than `currentExpirationPeriod`| `UpdateExpirationPeriod()` cannot be executed when the `newExpirationPeriod` is less than `currentExpirationPeriod`]]
- Check basic functions
	- `receive` and `withraw` - [[2023-07-baton_launchpad#[H-01] Protocol fees from NFT mints can't be claimed in `BatonLaunchpad`|[H-01] Protocol fees from NFT mints can't be claimed in `BatonLaunchpad`]]
- Verify that reward accounting remains accurate if reward tokens are added/removed from underlying protocols.
	- [[2023-04-blueberry#[M-12] `rewardTokens` removed from `WAuraPool/WConvexPools` will be lost forever|[M-12] `rewardTokens` removed from `WAuraPool/WConvexPools` will be lost forever]]
- Cached Value
	- Identify it
	- Check it
	- [[2023-03-Morpho#[M-14] Compound liquidity computation uses outdated cached borrowIndex]]
- When auditing transactions within a `for-loop`
	- [[2023-02-clober#[M-01] Group claim clashing condition|[M-01] Group claim clashing condition]]
- Check whether time-based epochs increase as expected
	- Epoch/period increments
	- Required sequential processing
	- Blocking conditions
	- [[2023-02-astaria#[H-11] `processEpoch()` needs to be called regularly[H-11] `processEpoch()` needs to be called regularly]]
- Check array parameter types (memory vs storage)
	- [[2023-02-astaria#[H-10] Refactor `_paymentAH()`]]
- Check  `owner â‰  msg.sender`
	- [[2023-02-astaria#[M-10] `redeemFutureEpoch` transfers the shares from the `msg.sender` to the vault instead of from the `owner`||[M-10] `redeemFutureEpoch` transfers the shares from the `msg.sender` to the vault instead of from the `owner`]]
# Typical Logical Issues

- Process Control Points vs. System Control Points
	- Interval calculation boundary alignment
	- Compare `@natspec` and code comment with actual implementation code
- Consistency
	- Look for multiple functions with similar names or purposes
    - Identify operations that handle the same business logic
    - Search for duplicated code with slight variations
    - Check for similar state mutations across different functions
    - Review functions that interact with the same state variables
- Multi-Step Bypass vie OR logic
	- Find all `OR` (`||`) condition in access controls
	- Can satisfying one condition affect other conditions?
	- Map out the relationship between each condition: `Condition A -> Changes State -> Enables Condition B?`
	- Try two-step attack
