*Business Logic - Logic vulnerabilities involve flaws in the business logic or protocols of a smart contract, where the implementation matches the developer's intention, but the underlying logic is inherently flawed.*

- The technical implementation matches the developer's intent
- The underlying logic can be strategically manipulated.
- The code does exactly what it was programmed to do.
- The vulnerability emerges from how the rules interact, not from a coding mistake.
