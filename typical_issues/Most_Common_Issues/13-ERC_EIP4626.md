# ERC / EIP 4626

Let me explain ERC4626, which is a powerful standard for tokenized vaults in Ethereum. Think of it like a standardized blueprint for creating investment containers in DeFi.

First, let's understand what a vault is in DeFi. Imagine a community pool where people can deposit their assets (like ETH or other tokens) and receive shares in return that represent their ownership of the pool. These shares can later be redeemed for their portion of the assets, potentially with returns if the vault has generated profits.

ERC4626 standardizes how these vaults should work. It builds upon two earlier standards you might be familiar with:
- ERC20: The standard for fungible tokens
- ERC20Metadata: The standard that adds name, symbol, and decimals to tokens

Here's what makes ERC4626 special:

Asset and Share Relationship:
Every ERC4626 vault works with two types of tokens:
1. The underlying asset token (what you deposit, like ETH)
2. The vault shares (what you receive in return, representing your ownership)

The vault maintains a relationship between these two, similar to how mutual fund shares work in traditional finance. When you deposit 1 ETH, you might receive 1 vault share, but this ratio can change as the vault generates returns.

Core Functions:
The standard requires vaults to implement several key functions:

For Deposits:
```solidity
// Calculate how many shares you'll get for depositing assets
function previewDeposit(uint256 assets) returns (uint256 shares)

// Actually perform the deposit
function deposit(uint256 assets, address receiver) returns (uint256 shares)
```

For Withdrawals:
```solidity
// Calculate how many assets you'll get for redeeming shares
function previewRedeem(uint256 shares) returns (uint256 assets)

// Actually perform the redemption
function redeem(uint256 shares, address receiver, address owner) returns (uint256 assets)
```

Accounting Functions:
```solidity
// Total assets the vault manages
function totalAssets() returns (uint256)

// Convert a given amount of assets to shares
function convertToShares(uint256 assets) returns (uint256 shares)

// Convert a given amount of shares to assets
function convertToAssets(uint256 shares) returns (uint256 assets)
```

The Beauty of Standardization:
This standardization brings several benefits:
1. Integration becomes easier - other protocols know exactly how to interact with any ERC4626 vault
2. Risk assessment becomes more straightforward - the standard functions make it clearer how the vault operates
3. Users get a consistent experience across different DeFi protocols

Example of How It Works:
Let's say a vault has:
- 100 ETH in total assets
- 100 total shares issued
- Current price ratio: 1 share = 1 ETH

If the vault generates a 10% return:
- Now has 110 ETH total
- Still 100 shares
- New price ratio: 1 share = 1.1 ETH

When someone wants to withdraw with 50 shares:
```solidity
assets = convertToAssets(50 shares)
// Would return 55 ETH (50 shares * 1.1 ETH per share)
```

This standardization helps prevent exactly the kind of vulnerability we discussed earlier - share prices should change only based on actual vault performance, not because of temporary asset availability.
