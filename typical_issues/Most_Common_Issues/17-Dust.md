# Dust

Dust refers to very small or negligible amounts of cryptocurrency, often below the precision threshold of a token's decimals. These tiny balances can accumulate in wallets or contracts and, if not managed properly, may lead to inefficiencies, increased gas costs, or even potential vulnerabilities in smart contracts.
